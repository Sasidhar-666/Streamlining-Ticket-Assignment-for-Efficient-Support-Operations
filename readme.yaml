## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Users** are defined and assigned **roles**.  
2. **Roles** are linked to **groups**.  
3. **Tables** store ticketing data (e.g., incidents, requests).  
4. **ACLs** control access, ensuring only authorized roles interact with specific tables.  
5. **Flows** (represented in screenshots) automate ticket routing to the right support group.
